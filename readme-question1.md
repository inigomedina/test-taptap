Question 1
==========

A string is a palindrome if it has exactly the same sequence of
characters when read left-to-right as it has when right-to-left. For
example, the following strings are palindromes:

	 - kayak
	 - civic
	 - radar

A string A is an anagram of a string B if A can be obtained from B by
rearranging the characters. For example, in each of the following
pairs one string is anagram of the other:

      - "mary" and "army"
      - "rocketboys" and "octobersky"
      - "taptap" and "taptap"

Write a function:

      class Solution {
      	    public boolean isAnagramOfPalindrome(String S);
      }

that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns
"true" if S is an anagram of some palindrome and returns "false"
otherwise.

Note: attach the code and some example of executions.
